# BITBOX SDK
This is a pure JavaScript fork of
the [BITBOX SDK](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/bitbox-sdk) maintained
by Bitcoin.com. It was forked 5/9/19. This fork of the repository will remove
babel and typescript as dependencies, making the code base pure JavaScript.
This removes the time-lag in compiling the library and also means that error messages
will indicate the actual lines of code (helpful), rather than lines in the
compiled output (less helpful).

I created this fork because I think many JavaScript developers are unwilling to
learn TypeScript, or simply hate compiled back-end apps like I do. This
repository is for
these marginalized developers. This fork will be maintained by
me ([Chris Troutner](https://memo.cash/profile/1NpYaazpQ26KrMTeFf66zVKy6x9KzcLgTA)) as
a hobby. There will most likely be a big lag when it comes to porting new
features in BITBOX to this repository.
